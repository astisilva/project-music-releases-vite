# Music Releases

- Create a React app that displays music releases using Spotify API data from a JSON file.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

- I began the project by carefully reading the requirements to understand what was needed. To get a clearer picture, I sketched out the main components of the project. Whenever I got stuck or needed explanations, I used Google and ChatGPT.

-The main part of the project was using React to create different pieces that fit together. It took a while because some parts I had forgot, but ChatGPT explained things and made it clearer. This project helped me practice what I already knew and learn some new things.

- If I hade more time I would have done the stretch goals
